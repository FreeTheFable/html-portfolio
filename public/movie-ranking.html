<h1>The Best Ghibli Movies According to Free</h1>

<h2>My top 3 Ghibli movies of all time.</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Spirited Away</h3>
<p>The visuals are amazing, and the soundtrack is timeless. The best song on the OST is "The Sixth Station" where, during the film, Chihiro and gang ride the train through a vast, mirrored lake. The best part of the song, and a huge reason why it's my favorite is because Chihiro watches as the shadow spirits board the train, but one singular girl doesn't board and is left alone on the platform, looking on at the train as it chugs away. The entire scene from start to finish is wistful and peaceful, a break from the tension from the previous scene and the mania of the bathhouse.</p>

<h3>Howl's Moving Castle</h3>
<p>Once again, the visuals are amazing, and Miyazaki/Ghibli adapt a slightly different story than the original book. I've never read the original, so I can't say if that's a good or bad thing, but I really enjoy what the movie does with it. One of my favorite scenes is the one where Sophie and gang have finished putting away the laundry while parked in the Wastes, and Sophie stares out at the scenery, remarking that "When you're old, all you want to do is to stare at the scenery." It's a timeless tale of both found family, and self-love found through the passion for caring for other people.</p>

<h3>Princess Mononoke</h3>
<p>I would rank the visuals slightly less impressive than the other two movies by fantastical scale, but the impressiveness shines through in its character and themes. My favorite piece of the film is probably the dichotomy between San and Eboshi, two women who are girlbossing it up and fighting for what they care for, though that puts them at odds with each other (at first).</p>
